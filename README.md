# Credit Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project assesses the credit quality of bank customers using machine learning. The goal is to classify customers as "Good" or "Bad" based on various attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset includes multiple customer features and a binary target variable representing credit quality.

## Methods
- **Logistic Regression**: Fitted with different probability thresholds (20%, 35%, 50%) to evaluate performance using confusion matrices.
- **Tree-based Models**: Classification trees, bagging, and random forests, compared against logistic regression using AUC and ROC curves.
- **Other Models**: k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were also explored.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Techniques applied to improve model fairness.

## Evaluation
The dataset is split into training and test sets for generalization assessment. Emphasis is placed on **accuracy, interpretability, and fairness** in predicting customer credit quality.
